# Learning Checklist

- Sub-sampled Voting: Avalanche employs repeated sub-sampled voting; validators consult a random subset of peers and may alter their preferences based on majority feedback.

- Unified Decision Aim: The goal is a unanimous outcome, with validators changing preferences based on α-majority and finalizing decisions after β consecutive confirmations.

- Flexible Parameterization: Nodes can customize parameters such as sample size and decision threshold, allowing tailored implementation of the consensus mechanism.

- Fast Finality and Consensus: Avalanche ensures rapid finalization of non-conflicting transactions and guarantees universal agreement amongst honest validators, resolving conflicts efficiently.
